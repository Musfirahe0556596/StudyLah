StudyLah

Motivation-
In this covid semester, it is especially hard for students to connect with one another. Freshmans like us are not familiar with the school and hardly have any chance to make friends in school as the majority of the lectures and tutorials are held online. 
While watching lectures, doing tutorials and assignments, you might be stuck with a question or are confused with certain concepts. It is inconvenient having no friends to ask and having to rely on online forums or emails to professors to ask a question. Such methods also have high time delays and might result in an individual feeling lonely and helpless, hence losing the motivation to study. 
Ever felt lazy or had no motivation to study? What if there is a platform for students studying the same modules to connect and discuss?
Thus, we wanted to create a web application, providing the students a platform to connect, expand their social circle and exchange their wisdom, helping one another in their studies, striving for better results.

Aim-
We hope to provide a platform for NUS students (and professors) to connect and forge friendship with each other through exchanging their knowledge in small study sessions.
